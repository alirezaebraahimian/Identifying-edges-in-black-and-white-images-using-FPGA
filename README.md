One application of programmable logic circuits involves deploying image processing algorithms. In this project, we'll explore the fundamental principles of edge detection in image processing. Here, an FPGA, functioning as a rapid processor, will process a black and white image, detect its edges, and then output the results. A black and white image can be described as a two-dimensional signal, characterized by two components, x and y, which are treated as continuous spatial axes. The brightness of each point in the image is denoted by f(x,y), formulated over these continuous spatial axes.
